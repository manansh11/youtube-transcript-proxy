{"text": " Welcome back. I got a wonderful question this morning, and I want to go over it He's getting very deep into the freeze. He's encountering the void He doesn't know what to do with the void and he's not encountering bliss Where's the bliss? Oh? My god for my childhood. There was this old windy's commercial. Where's the beef? Oh my god So where's the bliss to answer this? I want to go through the enlightenment pathway How that works through your brain how you can encounter bliss and especially what to do with that void? Why is it so important? What is going on? So let's get into it You Here's the question I'm stuck in this no-mind state after the freeze response and Like the proof smell out after passing the gauntlet of sleep It's like this avoid is left with awareness and like only the void is left But there isn't any bliss and the freeze gets stronger I've been in this state for a while now What do we need to understand to go beyond this? Do we need to soak in and enjoy the void is that what we do? Yes, first of all. Yes There isn't anything to focus it I mean the body gets mellowed out and gets Freezed how do we go beyond this to bliss? Because I haven't got any big bliss. I'm kind of craving bliss But more than that. I want to understand. What's this avoid and how to go beyond? I want to know how to progress beyond this Wonderful, so we're really really following Patanjali here. We're following Asana, I'm going to stretch the body then I'm going to learn to control the breath That is HRV resonance sitting very still noticing the four proofs getting into the parasympathetic system I need all of that to follow Patanjali if I'm not doing that I'm not following Patanjali because the next thing that will arise is this interiorization Pratya Hara that is interiorization and That comes about because of the freeze response those are Equal interiorization Freeze response those are equal So getting deep into the freeze is a Humongous milestone in the journey of the yogi because the body like you said my whole body is mellowed out It's going away and here. This is important to understand. I've said this before When you are deep into the freeze the four proofs will diminish You see the four proofs are proof that you are getting into your parasympathetic system But as the body gets into the freeze those proofs will diminish Along with your whole body the whole body is going away from your awareness Very slowly in the freeze and so the proofs will also go down So he mentions this doesn't he The proofs are going away Because you're getting into the freeze you don't need the proofs anymore You need the freeze the freeze becomes your new proof And now you're really at the crux of the yoga sutras You're really at the crux of Rajayoga, which is the state of interiorization This is the whole goal of the yogi is to get to this crux of the freeze response So when I wrote my book, I said look if we get into hv resonance And we sit very still and we encounter those four proofs This is the first half of the yogic body Just accomplishing that that is the entire first half of the yogic body And the second half the second you're now halfway through the book and you're getting into freeze response This is the second part of the yogic body that you are trying to cultivate by doing what hv resonance That is the thing which gets you into the parasympathetic It's the parasympathetic which finally gets you into this freeze response And it's glorious, this is the crux, okay? This is the crux of the yoga sutras Rajayoga, Kriayoga, this is the crux, the freeze response So glorious, right? Oh my god, you made it to the freeze response And you're getting deeper and deeper into it You're doing fantastic, but I want to point out to you that it will get deeper The freeze response is going to keep going and it will get deeper And the freeze response all by itself will become blissful You'll just hang out in the freeze and go, oh my god, this is blissful This is so blissful, I could just hang out here and I would be fine I would be great, I would consider myself a complete yogic success And you would be right, absolutely, this is the crux and it gets just the freeze response Really, really blissful, so I've had Cool waves go through the body, just really blissful I've had sensations of my body disappearing And you see your body is this humongous burden on you All of its demands, all of its worries, all of its concerns, all of its attachments And as that weight comes off of you, it's a relief Oh my god, this is such a relief Oh my god, it is so wonderful that it's blissful So keep going into the freeze, that's one answer The second answer and perhaps the most important answer is the void is what you are looking for I had this wonderful, wonderful yogi and he came into the void And he was actually coming into a complete void The body was completely disappearing, it was gone, gone, gone Which means he was only there with the void, so your sense of consciousness, right I am, the I am consciousness inside of you And one with the void, there's nothing else, you see Nothing, nothing, nothing else, he came into the state Again and again, and he wrote to me, he described this I'm like, well, that's a non dual state, that's samadhi And he goes, okay, but it's just a void And what he said, it was so perfect, and we both recognized how this was such a perfect language Okay, what do I do so that I can get to the next place What do I do so I can get, that's your left brain, that's your left brain So your left brain is coming in and judging your experience Don't I have to do, do, do, so I can progress, progress, progress and go, go, go And it's all these left brain, do, do, do, right Like the chicken pecking at the seed, it looks at it with this right eye, which is cross-connected to your left brain I will do it, right, that's your left brain, what do I do so I can get, right, that's your left brain Which goes to show you can come deep into a samadhi, deep into the void and still we have lots to learn We have lots to soak in and become And I told him, as I'm going to tell you, the void is what you're looking for Your deep into the right brain, your deep into the place you want to soak everything in You're into the beginning of this non-dual state So have you lost your body completely? If you lost it completely and you can't find it, then you're in a non-dual state You're in a samadhi, if the body is still there, then you're in an absorption Right, I can sense my body and I can also sense all of this void Beautiful, now you're communing very very very deeply with the higher self, right? Sometimes we have this idea that we're going to go into these very deep states And we're going to have a lot of communication back and forth, that can happen That is a download state and it's taking place when you are more on the left side of your brain So I'm praying to divine mother, I'm praying to my favorite, to my ishta My favorite form of the divine, my favorite form of the higher self I'm praying to that form and I get an answer from that form And to do all of that, I'm using the processes on the left side of my brain I'm still using the deep brain, I'm using my heart Which is connected to the left amygdala of love and bliss That's the part of my brain, I'm using to say that prayer To go deeply and to get an answer, I'm really charging up that left amygdala side of my brain But when we're heading into the stillness, when we're using Raja Yoga, when we're using Kriya Yoga, when we're using the freeze response to get very very deep, then we're heading towards the non-dual side of your brain, you're heading towards the right brain, specifically the right hippocampus and this is where we have spaciousness, we have the intelligence, the consciousness of the divine, we have the void and we have pure silence, all of that is contained in the right brain, that's the part of your brain, you're going to use to encounter all of that And there's no language there, there's no talking there, there's not an experience there, a lot of experience, it's just one thing and you are either communing with that oneness and you're not quite one with it or you're one with it and there's nothing else there's no talking to you in that state, okay? Have you ever experienced where you come and you see the ocean and it's so big and it's so beautiful or you go out on a starry night and you look up at the stars and there's so many, it's just so huge, it's overwhelming the beauty and the glory of it, or you climb the mountain and you go to the top and you just, I went on this very long hike and I saw all of the Rocky Mountains stretched out, seven, I think it was a seven mile hike, we climbed all the way up and I saw all of the Rocky stretched out, it was so glorious and all of those mountains were just singing, the silence was singing, so you can see the stars and they can be singing to you, you can see the ocean, it can be speaking to you without speaking, you can climb the mountain and they can be singing in silence and now you're tasting that right brain, it doesn't speak to you, if it speaks to you, you're in a download, you're still using some of your left brain, when you get very, very deep into the right brain, there's no talking, it just is, it's so big, it's so huge, it just is, there's nothing to say, you finished the story, you came to the end, there's no more talking, it's complete all onto itself and so it just vibrates, it just is, it just speaks in silence, there's no back and forth anymore, the back and forth, that was the story to get to the non-dual, so when you're in the void, what do I do, I soak it in, I have arrived, there is no doing to get, there's no more accomplishing, you just soak it in, this is what I came for, this is that resonating silence, you're in the place that you were looking for, you are communing with the higher self in its completeness and then you get sucked into it and you become one with it, you are whole and complete and there's nothing to say and then you come out of that state then you can think about it or you can come out of that state and you have a download, you get an understanding and now we have the right brain communicating with the left brain and then the left brain might have more questions and we come back into that state, we come back out and it communicates again and that's the back and forth between the two hemispheres. So in meditation we're on this journey, we're deep into the processes of being a person in the left brain, we're using all of those, we're deeply embedded and attached and craving and just locked up with all of that and slowly we're unlocking ourselves and we're on a journey towards the right brain and as we get closer and closer we might have downloads, we might have the beginning of communication and then we get deep into either expansion or the intelligence, the consciousness of everything, the consciousness of wholeness, we might get the void or we might get pure silence, all of that, we start to touch any and all of that, these are all possible absorptions. Now all we do is soak that in, that's it, we have arrived in the palace, what you do in the palace, you sit down and you enjoy the palace. But forest, where is the bliss? That's right, so I call this whole thing, this is the enlightenment pathway and I talk about this in my third training which is on my website, there'll be a link below, if you want to see this whole thing mapped out over and over again with pictures, it's very, very good to know, we want to know how this is working in the brain so that we can zero in on the processes which we need to do to encounter these deep parts of the brain and to make all of these pieces work, that's a lot of what that third training is all about. Okay forest but how do I encounter this bliss, why am I not encountering this bliss? And this is a wonderful question, you know that bliss is supposed to show up, but for a yogi who is only concentrated on the non-dual state or for a Buddhist who is only concentrated on nothingness, that bliss can take a very, very long time to show up and so what's happening, we're on this journey into the right brain, we start to encounter the right brain and that charge builds up and builds up and builds up in the right brain and then finally it's so strong, the charge jumps through the right amygdala of fear and this is why we're doing Navi Kriya, so I talk a lot about Navi Kriya and why it is essential for the yogi, so we're passing through that right amygdala, the charge passes through that and then it connects all the way over through the anterior commissure, it connects over to the left amygdala, which is bliss and now we are in the right brain, but now we've, the charge is connected all the way to the left amygdala of bliss, so we're in expansion but the charge has cross connected all the way over to bliss and we're left with expansion or nothingness or silence and bliss, now we are complete Satchit Ananda and this is why the yogi say so perfectly so correctly, look you found the expanse, you found the infinite intelligence, you found the nothingness, stay there, keep growing that, keep soaking that up because it's not exactly complete until you have that bliss as well, so the charge is going to build up, how does it build up, we stay there, we soak it in and then finally it cross connects all the way over and the bliss lights up as well, now we have Satchit Ananda, there's also a trick and the trick is you can just start building bliss and so what do I talk about a lot, the cute baby meditation, Todd Murphy brought up this exercise to me wonderfully, it's from a very old Buddhist text and it's just glorious, the cute baby is just glorious, it's so easy to look at something so innocent and so pure and go oh my god it's so cute and now your heart is lighting up and maybe it's not lighting up this much but maybe it's lighting up this much or maybe it's a puppy or maybe it's a kitten or maybe it's a llama or maybe I've seen cute seals or maybe it's a funny and joyous and something something to light up your heart you can look at it and it just your heart lights up like that instantly maybe it's this much that's fine that's how much we're going to hold the weight of the left amygdala right so I see the cute baby my heart lights up oh my god and I had a wonderful student come to me much like this yogi and he said forest I'm going really deep it's really wonderful but yet I'm not encountering bliss what do I do I said practice cute baby every single day he says I have this cute chihuahua I look at my chihuahua my heart lights up can I do that absolutely do it every day every day at least five minutes every single day and he called me back in one week he says I've been seeing the spiritual eye for years years and years and years I've been seeing the spiritual eye and after practicing cute baby for one week cute baby meditation just a few minutes like five minutes five ten minutes every day one week I have bliss coming out of my spiritual eye for the very very first time so if you can practice a little bit of cute baby on the side it doesn't have to be all day just five minutes here maybe you have another five minutes there and the more you light up your heart and make that connection with your left amygdala and use your left amygdala it's going to be easier for you to come into this deep state and then very without trying spontaneously have that left amygdala show up as well so all of my students who practice the silence and practice cute baby this happens much faster than we have from the old stories of yogis for them it would take a very long time for the Buddhists it would take a very long time the charge would build up they keep cleaning themselves out which we are doing with the Om Chapa right but whether you like it or not the journey inside is a process of cleaning yourself out you have to face yourself you have to accept yourself you have to let go you have to forgive so you're cleaning yourself out and along the way you cross connect to that left amygdala and finally you have the void and you have bliss as well so fantastic question you're not trying to progress beyond you want to soak in the void as you guessed keep soaking that in and also occasionally play with the cute baby meditation and counter some of that bliss practice the bliss so it's easier to connect to in your deep meditations you won't have to do anything it will just spontaneously arise so understanding all of these pieces of the brain the left amygdala the right hippocampus I'm getting out of my left brain personality all of this is tremendously valuable because it makes the path clear you don't have to do a lot of guessing you can actually understand the process so hope you love this if you did be sure to have that bell down below so I can see all of you next time", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 6.5200000000000005, "text": " Welcome back.
